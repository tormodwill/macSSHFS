# macSSHFS
mac version of sshfs.

This is a mac version of 
https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs


In coexistence with macSSHFS, we also have 
https://github.com/osxfuse/sshfs
The osxfuse/sshfs has not been updated since 2014, hence this separate version.

As of february 2022, this page will distribute an install package of
SSHFS version 2.10.0.

The SSHFS version 2.10.0 is a performance update of version 2.5.0
The performance improvements are significant.

This version is based on version 2.10.0 for linux
( https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs )

The reason for offering this as a separate install package, is that is not for the average mac user to compile the sshfs linux version.

The goal for macSSHFS repository will be to include support for macOS to libfuse 3.
If this can be achived, than it will be possible to compile the newest versions of sshfs for macOS.

The maintainer of this version, Tormod Willassen, is totally dependent of contributors in order to be able to supply updates, new versions
and bugfixes.
